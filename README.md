## Mobile Picker

Mobile Picker is a customizable component designed for web, allowing users to select options in a user-friendly, native-mobile-like interface. It presents choices in a scrollable format, making it easy to navigate through multiple options.

## Features

- **iOS-style Interface**: Mimics the look and feel of native iOS pickers.
- **Controlled Content**: Define how each item looks and behaves, allowing for a tailored user experience.

## Usage

The widget requires an association and a list of items. When an item is selected in the Picker, it will set the association.

1. Add the widget to the page.
2. Select an association to be set when an item is chosen.
3. Set the selectable objects that will populate the Picker.
4. Define the content for each item; a simple text field works well.
